# ☀️ The Green Transition: Solar Energy in Egypt

## 🌍 Project Description

Egypt stands at the cusp of a green transformation. Despite abundant solar resources, many industrial and service sector establishments remain dependent on conventional energy sources. This project explores how the transition to **solar energy** can drive sustainability and profitability in Egypt's **industrial operations, service-based facilities, and agricultural sector**.

The primary objective of our study is to analyze the economic and environmental outcomes of adopting solar technology across a selection of real-life commercial, industrial, and agricultural sites — including factories, gas stations, and farms — over a 25-year period.

Our goal was to explore the real, measurable impact of **green technology** — specifically, **solar energy** — in different sectors across Egypt. We asked the big questions:  
- Does switching to solar really save money?  
- Is it worth the investment long-term?  
- How does it affect CO₂ emissions?  
- And which types of businesses benefit the most?

Using data from 15 different solar projects implemented over the last 25 years — ranging from massive industrial sites like **Dina Farms** and **ASCOM** to local **gas stations** and agricultural projects including **Alfalfa, Corn, Cotton, and Pomegranate farms** — we conducted a deep data analysis to uncover the financial and environmental results of going green.

This project is not just a technical case study — it's a **call to action**. The goal is to **raise awareness** and **encourage businesses in Egypt** to adopt renewable energy, showing them the concrete benefits through storytelling, data, and visualization. We want decision-makers, investors, and the public to see that solar is not just good for the planet — it's also smart business.

## 📚 Data Sources

We analyzed 25 years of real-world data from:
- 🏭 **Six factories** including Dina Farms and ASCOM  
- ⛽ **Six gas stations** including El Kharga, Kom Omboh, and Salah  
- 🌾 **Four agricultural projects** covering Alfalfa crops, Corn new lands, Cotton crops, and Pomegranate farms

Each project included values such as:
- `Produced_from_Solar_MWh`: Solar energy generated annually
- `Cost_saved_EGP`: Yearly cost savings from using solar
- `Maintenance_Cost_EGP`: Annual maintenance costs
- `Net_savings(EGP)`: Total financial savings after maintenance
- `Energy_From_Grid_MWh`: Electricity taken from the national grid
- `Total_Supplied_Elec_MWh`: Total electricity consumption
- `Self_Suff_Percent`: Solar dependency percentage
- `CO2_Reduction_tons`: Annual emissions avoided
- `ROI_Percent`: Return on investment

## 🌱 Agricultural Sector Insights

Our analysis of solar adoption in Egypt's agricultural sector reveals:

### Solar vs. Diesel Cost Comparison
- Traditional diesel irrigation costs reach **EGP 350,000/year** per farm
- Solar systems reduce energy costs by:
  - **48.5%** for Corn fields (Com_1)
  - **20.7%** for Pomegranate farms (PMG_1)
  - **63.3%** for Cotton crops (highest savings)

### Environmental Impact
- **30,000+ kg CO₂ reduction/year** achieved by Corn fields
- Significant emission cuts across all crop types

### Key Benefits for Agriculture
1. **Stable Costs**: Solar eliminates volatile diesel prices
2. **Higher Profitability**: Cotton farms show highest returns
3. **Sustainable Irrigation**: Reduces carbon footprint of water-intensive crops

**Recommendation**: Prioritize solar adoption for water-intensive crops (Cotton, Corn) to maximize both economic and environmental benefits.


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – for data cleaning, EDA, and correlation analysis  
- **SQL** – to extract and manipulate project data  
- **Power BI** – for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling  
- **Excel** – for data preparation and project-wide calculations  
- **Google Colab** – for Python notebooks and collaboration
- **Time Series Modeling** – ARIMA(1,1,0) and SARIMAX (with interest‐ & exchange‐rate exogenous variables) to forecast Egypt’s
  inflation rate and show investors how locking in today’s solar returns outpaces future inflation

## 📈 Inflation Prediction Modeling

We leveraged statistical time-series models to predict Egypt’s inflation trajectory and underscore the value of investing now:

1. **ARIMA(1,1,0)**  
   - Quick to fit and interpret.  
   - Captures baseline inflation trends.  

2. **SARIMAX**  
   - Built on ARIMA, with **exogenous** regressors:  
     - **Interest Rate**  
     - **Exchange Rate**  
   - Yields more accurate, context-aware forecasts.  

✅ **Outcome**: By showing that expected inflation will erode future purchasing power, we demonstrate that early solar investments lock in real savings over the next 25 years.
