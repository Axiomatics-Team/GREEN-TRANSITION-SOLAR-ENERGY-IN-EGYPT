# ☀️ The Green Transition: Solar Energy in Egypt

## 🌍 Project Description

Egypt stands at the cusp of a green transformation. Despite abundant solar resources, many industrial and service sector establishments remain dependent on conventional energy sources. This project explores how the transition to **solar energy** can drive sustainability and profitability in Egypt’s **industrial operations and service-based facilities**.

The primary objective of our study is to analyze the economic and environmental outcomes of adopting solar technology across a selection of real-life commercial and industrial sites — including factories, gas stations, and a large resort — over a 25-year period.

We utilized actual energy performance data from 13 solar installations to:

Our goal was to explore the real, measurable impact of **green technology** — specifically, **solar energy** — in different sectors across Egypt. We asked the big questions:  
- Does switching to solar really save money?  
- Is it worth the investment long-term?  
- How does it affect CO₂ emissions?  
- And which types of businesses benefit the most?

Using data from 13 different solar projects implemented over the last 25 years — ranging from massive industrial sites like **Dina Farms** and **ASCOM** to local **gas stations** and the impressive **Somabay Resort** — we conducted a deep data analysis to uncover the financial and environmental results of going green.

This project is not just a technical case study — it’s a **call to action**. The goal is to **raise awareness** and **encourage businesses in Egypt** to adopt renewable energy, showing them the concrete benefits through storytelling, data, and visualization. We want decision-makers, investors, and the public to see that solar is not just good for the planet — it’s also smart business.

## 📚 Data Sources

We analyzed 25 years of real-world data from:
- 🏭 **Six factories** including Dina Farms and ASCOM  
- ⛽ **Six gas stations** including El Kharga, Kom Omboh, and Salah  
- 🏖️ **Somabay Resort**, a large-scale renewable energy site

Each project included values such as:
- `Produced_from_Solar_MWh`: Solar energy generated annually
- `Cost_saved_EGP`: Yearly cost savings from using solar
- `Maintenance_Cost_EGP`: Annual maintenance costs
- `Net_savings(EGP)`: Total financial savings after maintenance
- `Energy_From_Grid_MWh`: Electricity taken from the national grid
- `Total_Supplied_Elec_MWh`: Total electricity consumption
- `Self_Suff_Percent`: Solar dependency percentage
- `CO2_Reduction_tons`: Annual emissions avoided
- `ROI_Percent`: Return on investment

## 🔎 Deeper Data Insights

### 🌞 Solar Energy Powers the Benefits
- **Perfect correlation (1.00)** between solar energy generation and:
  - Cost Saved 💰
  - Net Savings 📈
  - CO₂ Reduction 🌍
  
✅ **Insight**: The more solar energy produced, the more financial and environmental gains.

---

### ⚡ Selling Back to the Grid Pays Off
- Exporting energy to the national grid shows **strong positive correlation** with:
  - Cost savings (0.94)
  - Net savings (0.95)
  - CO₂ reduction (0.94)
  
✅ **Insight**: Surplus solar energy = extra income + reduced emissions.

---

### 💸 ROI Grows Over Time
- ROI increases alongside:
  - Cumulative net savings (0.92)
  - Years (0.99)
  
✅ **Insight**: Solar systems get more profitable every year. Long-term investments = big rewards.

---

### 🛠️ Maintenance Costs Rise Over Time
- Strong positive correlation with time (0.91)
- Negative correlation with efficiency (-0.91)

✅ **Insight**: Older systems cost more to maintain and perform worse. Preventive care matters.

---

### 🔋 Self-Sufficiency = Smarter Strategy
- Higher solar dependency means:
  - Less reliance on the national grid
  - Higher ROI
  - Lower carbon footprint

✅ **Insight**: Maximize internal solar use, especially in isolated or high-consumption areas.

---

### 🏭 Industries vs. ⛽ Gas Stations vs. 🏖️ Resorts
- Gas stations: Quicker ROI due to lower setup costs
- Industries: Strong long-term savings
- Somabay Resort: Highest total cost savings due to its size and solar coverage
